## TODOs

- Debug / dry run mode that just prints the request that will be sent.
- Pass in extra variables that overwrite things in env as command line args.
- Better error handling, especially around request execution.
- Better separation between parsing and execution.

## Ideas

- Rewrite request file parsing with [nom](https://github.com/Geal/nom)?
